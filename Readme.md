# jbundler #

just add it as **first** entry in your *Gemfile* (pending since no gem is released)

```gem 'jbundler'```

when having this lib directory on the loadpath just

```require 'jbundler'```

or run it directly

```jruby -Ilib lib/jbundler.rb```

to get the classpath setup in *.jbundler/classpath*
